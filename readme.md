# Description
This little program lets you decrypt a Bioshock addon zip using the original Bioshock game files. **Neither this nor the encrypted addon zip contain any of the copyrighted original Bioshock assets**, you will need to provide these yourself by following the steps below. 

The addon zip is encrypted by doing a bitwise XOR on the zip and a combination of Bioshock game files. Decrypting is done by doing another bitwise XOR on the encrypted zip and the same combination of Bioshock game files.

# Requirements
- BS2HLA.exe
- An installation of Bioshock
- The encrypted addon zip
    - You can get this here: 

# How to use
1. Run the BS2HLA.exe (problems? See notes below)
2. Provide the path to your Bioshock installation. For example: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bioshock*.
3. Provide the path to the encrypted zip. For example: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\medical_pavilion_lobby.zip*.
4. Hit decrypt and let er ripp.
5. Unzip the contents of the decrypted addon zip into your Half Life Alyx *\content\hlvr_addons* folder. For example: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\content\hlvr_addons*.
6. Select the map from "Local Addons" in game.
7. Enjoy!

# NOTES:
- The zip does not contain any original Bioshock assets. You WILL need to provide these assets yourself or the data is useless.
- It can take a couple of seconds for the program to start up, please be patient :)
- Windows is not a fan of unknown executables so will throw up a smartscreen window. Just press "More info" and "Run anyway".
- It's also possible that your anti-virus might see the program as a virus. You can add an exception for BS2HLA.exe or if you don't trust it use the instructions below to run the source python script directly.

# Run the python script
- Have python 3.6 or higher installed.
- Make just python is added to the PATH enviroment variable.
- Download the python script from this page (top right -> green "code" button -> Download zip)
- Open a command prompt (Ctrl+R -> "cmd" -> Enter)
- Use the following command: *cd* [path of the folder which contains the .py file]
- Use the following command: *python bs2hla.py*
- Follow steps from how to use from step 2 onwards.
